       CHAPTER 3: WEBSITE STRUCTURE DESIGN


1. Define Information Architecture (IA).
• 	Information Architecture (IA) is the structural design of information within a digital product (like a website or app).
• 	It organizes and labels content to make it easy to find, understand, and navigate.

2. What is a “Wireframe”?
• 	A wireframe is a basic visual layout of a webpage or app.
• 	It shows the structure, placement of elements, and navigation flow without detailed design or colors.

3. Explain the concept of “Cognitive Friction” in web design.
• 	Cognitive Friction occurs when a user struggles to understand or use an interface.
• 	It happens due to confusing design, unclear instructions, or unexpected behavior, slowing down task completion.

4. Why should URL slugs use hyphens instead of underscores?
• 	Search engines like Google treat hyphens as word separators, improving readability and SEO.
• 	Underscores are not recognized as separators, making URLs harder to read and less search-friendly

Group B: Long Questions
Q5. Compare and contrast Hierarchical (Tree) structure and Linear (Sequential) structure.
• 	Hierarchical (Tree) Structure:
• 	Information is organized in a parent–child relationship.
• 	Allows branching into categories and subcategories.
• 	Easy navigation for large, complex websites.
• 	Example: An e-commerce site where the homepage branches into categories like “Electronics → Mobile Phones → Accessories.”
• 	Linear (Sequential) Structure:
• 	Information is arranged step by step in a straight line.
• 	Users move forward or backward one step at a time.
• 	Best for processes or tutorials.
• 	Example: An online course module where lessons must be completed in sequence.
Comparison:
• 	Hierarchical = flexible, multi-path navigation.
• 	Linear = rigid, step-by-step navigation.
• 	Use hierarchical for large content sites, linear for guided processes.

Q6. Explain the “Three-Click Rule” and its significance in User Experience (UX) design.
• 	Definition: The Three-Click Rule suggests that users should be able to reach any piece of information on a website within three clicks.
• 	Significance:
• 	Reduces frustration and improves usability.
• 	Encourages clear navigation and logical structure.
• 	Helps retain users by making content easily accessible.
• 	Note: While not a strict law, it’s a guideline to ensure efficiency and user satisfaction.

Q7.“Plan before you do.” Explain how tools like Card Sorting and Flowcharts help in planning a website’s structure.
• 	Card Sorting:
• 	Users group topics into categories using cards.
• 	Reveals how people naturally organize information.
• 	Helps design intuitive menus and navigation.
• 	Flowcharts:
• 	Visual diagrams showing the sequence of pages and links.
• 	Clarifies relationships between sections.
• 	Prevents confusion by mapping user journeys before development.
Overall:
Both tools ensure the website is user-centered, logical, and efficient before coding begins, saving time and reducing redesign later.

Q8. Website Structure for a University
• 	Best Structural Model: Hierarchical (Tree Structure)
• 	A university website has multiple categories (Admissions, Departments, Alumni, News).
• 	A hierarchical model organizes content into parent-child relationships, making navigation intuitive.
Justification:
• 	Easy scalability for hundreds of pages.
• 	Clear navigation paths (e.g., Home → Admissions → Undergraduate → Apply).
• 	Helps users quickly locate information without confusion.
Rough Diagram:
Home
 ├── Admissions
 │    ├── Undergraduate
 │    ├── Postgraduate
 │    └── International Students
 ├── Departments
 │    ├── Science
 │    ├── Arts
 │    └── Engineering
 ├── Alumni
 │    ├── Events
 │    └── Success Stories
 └── News
      ├── Announcements
      └── Press Releases


Q9. Design Failure Analysis (KISS Principle)
• 	Scenario: User leaves because navigation menu is hidden behind a small icon.
• 	KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid):
• 	Websites should prioritize simplicity and clarity.
• 	Hiding the main navigation behind a small icon (like a hamburger menu) on a desktop screen violates this principle.
Analysis:
• 	On desktop, users expect visible navigation menus.
• 	Hiding it adds unnecessary complexity and forces extra clicks.
• 	Result: Poor user experience → high bounce rate.
Correct Approach:
• 	Keep navigation visible and straightforward on desktop.
• 	Use hamburger menus only for mobile screens where space is limited.

Q10. Bad URL Structure in E-commerce
• 	Given URL:www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9

• 	Problems:
• 	For Users: Not readable, doesn’t convey product meaning.
• 	For SEO: Search engines prefer descriptive URLs. Parameters () don’t provide context.
Better Structure with Page Slugs:
• 	Use descriptive slugs that include product and category names.
• 	Example:www.shop.com/electronics/smartphone/samsung-galaxy-s24

• 	Benefits:
• 	User-friendly → easy to remember and share.
• 	SEO-friendly → keywords in URL improve ranking.
• 	Clear hierarchy → category → product.
