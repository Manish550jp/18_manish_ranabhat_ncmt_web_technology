 CHAPTER 2 : WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS


1. Define the term “Sitemap” in the planning phase
- A sitemap is a structured outline or diagram that shows the hierarchy and organization of all pages in a website.
- It helps visualize how content will be arranged and how users will navigate through the site.

2. What is the purpose of the “Launch” phase in web development?
- The launch phase is when the completed website is deployed to a live server and made accessible to users.
- It ensures final testing, bug fixing, and optimization are done before the site goes public.

3. Why is “Documentation” important in the development lifecycle?
- Documentation provides detailed records of design decisions, code structure, APIs, and processes.
- It helps developers maintain, update, and troubleshoot the system efficiently, and supports knowledge transfer to new team members.

4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end developmenT
-Front-end Development: Deals with the user interface and experience, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design what users see and interact with.
-Back-end Development: Handles server-side logic, databases, and application functionality, ensuring data processing and system performance.

Long Question Answer
5. “Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss this statement by listing the key activities performed during the planning phase.
Planning is considered the most critical phase because it lays the foundation for the entire web development process. Without proper planning, projects often face delays, cost overruns, or fail to meet user needs.
Key activities in the planning phase:
- Requirement Analysis: Identifying the purpose of the website, its goals, and expected outcomes.
- Defining Target Audience: Understanding who will use the site and tailoring features accordingly.
- Scope Definition: Outlining the functionalities, features, and limitations of the project.
- Technology Selection: Choosing suitable platforms, frameworks, and tools for development.
- Budgeting and Resource Allocation: Estimating costs, time, and assigning roles to team members.
- Project Timeline Creation: Setting milestones and deadlines for each stage of development.
- Risk Assessment: Identifying potential challenges and planning mitigation strategies.
( In short, planning ensures clarity, direction, and efficiency, making it the backbone of successful web development.)

6. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly “finished”?
The Maintenance phase is iterative because websites require continuous updates and improvements even after launch. Technology, user needs, and business goals evolve, so the site must adapt.
Reasons why maintenance is iterative:
- Bug Fixes: Errors and glitches are discovered over time and need correction.
- Content Updates: Information must be refreshed to stay relevant and accurate.
- Security Enhancements: New threats emerge, requiring regular patches and updates.
- Performance Optimization: Improving speed, responsiveness, and user experience.
- Feature Upgrades: Adding new functionalities based on user feedback or market trends.
- Compatibility Adjustments: Ensuring the site works with new browsers, devices, or operating systems.
( A website is never truly “finished” because it must evolve continuously to remain secure, functional, and valuable to its audience.)

7. Describe the process of “Information Gathering.” Why is understanding the target audience crucial during this step?
Information Gathering is the initial step in web development where developers and stakeholders collect data to guide design and functionality.
Process of Information Gathering:
- Identify Objectives: Clarify the purpose of the website (e.g., e-commerce, education, portfolio).
- Collect Stakeholder Input: Gather requirements from clients, managers, or end-users.
- Research Competitors: Study similar websites to identify strengths and weaknesses.
- Define Target Audience: Understand demographics, preferences, and behavior patterns.
- Document Requirements: Create a detailed list of features, content needs, and design expectations.
Importance of understanding the target audience:
- Ensures the website meets user needs and expectations.
- Helps in designing user-friendly navigation and layout.
- Guides tone, style, and type of content presented.
- Improves engagement, satisfaction, and conversion rates.
- Prevents wasted resources on irrelevant features.
( In essence, knowing the target audience ensures the website is purposeful, effective, and user-centered.)

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions
8. You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the
”Testing” phase to save money and launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaining
the potential risks (security, functionality, compatibility) of skipping this phase.

Persuasive Argument Against Skipping the Testing Phase
Skipping the Testing phase may seem like a cost-saving shortcut, but it introduces serious risks that could ultimately cost far more in reputation, customer trust, and financial loss:
• 	Security Risks
• 	Without testing, vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or weak authentication may go unnoticed.
• 	Hackers could exploit these flaws, leading to data breaches, stolen customer information, and legal consequences.
• 	Functionality Risks
• 	Core features like checkout, payment gateways, or inventory updates may fail under real-world usage.
• 	Bugs left unchecked could frustrate customers, cause abandoned carts, and reduce sales.
• 	Compatibility Risks
• 	E-commerce sites must work across multiple browsers, devices, and operating systems.
• 	Skipping testing risks alienating mobile users or those on less common platforms, shrinking the customer base.
Conclusion: Testing is not an optional luxury—it’s a safeguard. Launching without it is like opening a store without checking if the doors lock, the cash register works, or the shelves are stable. The short-term savings will be outweighed by long-term losses.

9. A developer begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating
a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze
what went wrong in the process and how it should have been handled
Analysis of Developer’s Mistake
What went wrong:
• 	The developer jumped straight into coding without a design prototype or sitemap.
• 	This meant there was no visual or structural agreement with the client before development began.
• 	As a result, the client rejected the layout midway, wasting time and resources.
How it should have been handled:
• 	Requirement Gathering: First, clarify the client’s needs, goals, and target audience.
• 	Design Prototype: Create wireframes or mockups to visualize the layout and user flow.
• 	Sitemap: Outline the site’s structure to ensure logical navigation.
• 	Client Approval: Present these artifacts to the client for feedback and approval before coding.
By following this process, the developer would have avoided rework and ensured alignment with the client’s expectations.

10. A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped
visiting it because the exam schedules were outdated. Which phase of the development
lifecycle was neglected? Explain the activities involved in this phase
Neglected Phase in the Development Lifecycle
-The neglected phase was the Maintenance Phase.
Why:
• 	The site was launched successfully, but after six months, exam schedules were outdated.
• 	Maintenance ensures that content, features, and security updates remain relevant and functional after launch.
Activities in the Maintenance Phase:
• 	Content Updates: Regularly updating exam schedules, announcements, and academic calendars.
• 	Bug Fixes: Addressing errors reported by users.
• 	Performance Monitoring: Ensuring the site remains fast and accessible.
• 	Security Patches: Applying updates to protect against new threats.
• 	User Feedback Integration: Adjusting features based on student needs and usage patterns.
Neglecting maintenance turns a successful launch into a failed long-term project. A website is a living system—it must evolve to stay useful.
