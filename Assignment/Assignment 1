             CHAPTER 1: AN OVERVIEW OF THE INTERNET AND THE WEB



1. Define the term “Protocol” in the context of the Internet
• 	A protocol is a set of rules and standards that govern how data is transmitted and received over the Internet.
• 	Examples include HTTP, FTP, TCP/IP, which ensure proper communication between devices.

2. What is the primary difference between a Web Browser and a Search Engine
• 	A Web Browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) is software used to access and display web pages.
• 	A Search Engine (e.g., Google, Bing) is a service that helps users find web pages by indexing and retrieving information based on keywords.

3. Define the World Wide Web (WWW)
• 	The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents and multimedia content accessed via the Internet using web browsers.
• 	It uses protocols like HTTP to connect users to websites.

4. Distinguish between a static web page and a dynamic web page
• 	Static Web Page:
• 	Fixed content, same for all users.
• 	Created using HTML only.
• 	Example: A company’s “About Us” page.
• 	Dynamic Web Page:
• 	Content changes based on user interaction or server-side processing.
• 	Uses technologies like PHP, JavaScript, or databases.
• 	Example: Social media feeds or e-commerce product pages.

5. Explain the Client-Server Architecture of the Web with neat diagram
• 	Concept:
The web follows a client-server model, where the client (usually a web browser) requests services, and the server (web server) provides responses.
• 	Process:
1. 	The client sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server.
2. 	The server processes the request, retrieves data (like HTML, CSS, images, or scripts), and sends it back.
3. 	The client displays the content to the user.
• 	Key Features:
• 	Separation of roles: client handles user interface, server handles data storage and processing.
• 	Scalability: multiple clients can connect to one server.
• 	Security: servers often authenticate clients and encrypt communication.
• 	Diagram:    [ Client (Browser) ]  <--->  [ Server (Web Server) ]
          Request                  Response 


6. Describe the functions of the following Internet services: Email, FTP, and VoIP
Functions of Internet Services
• 	Email (Electronic Mail):
• 	Allows sending and receiving text, files, and multimedia over the Internet.
• 	Uses protocols like SMTP (sending), POP3/IMAP (receiving).
• 	Provides asynchronous communication (sender and receiver don’t need to be online at the same time).
• 	FTP (File Transfer Protocol):
• 	Used to upload, download, and manage files between computers.
• 	Supports authentication (username/password).
• 	Commonly used for website maintenance and sharing large files.
• 	VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol):
• 	Enables voice communication over the Internet instead of traditional phone lines.
• 	Converts voice signals into digital packets.
• 	Examples: Skype, WhatsApp calls, Zoom.
• 	Cost-effective and supports additional features like video calls and conferencing.

7. ”The Internet is a network of networks.” Elaborate on this statement explaining how
packet switching works.
“The Internet is a Network of Networks” & Packet Switching
• 	Statement Meaning:
• 	The Internet is not a single network but a collection of interconnected networks (LANs, WANs, ISPs, etc.).
• 	These networks communicate using standard protocols (TCP/IP).
• 	Packet Switching:
• 	Data is broken into small units called packets.
• 	Each packet contains:
• 	Header (source, destination, sequence info).
• 	Payload (actual data).
• 	Packets travel independently across different routes in the network.
• 	At the destination, packets are reassembled in the correct order.

• 	Advantages:

• 	Efficient use of bandwidth.
• 	Fault tolerance (packets can reroute if a path fails).
• 	Supports multiple users simultaneously.
• 	Example:
• 	When you send an email, it is divided into packets, transmitted across various networks,  

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions
Q8. A startup company wants to host a website that displays the same information to all visitors and requires very low maintenance costs. However, they are being advised to use a dynamic website. As a consultant, would you agree? Justify your answer.
Answer:
• 	No, I would not agree.
• 	A static website is more appropriate because:
• 	Displays the same information to all visitors.
• 	Low hosting and maintenance cost.
• 	Faster loading speed since no server-side processing is required.
• 	A dynamic website would add unnecessary complexity (databases, scripts, higher costs).
( Conclusion: Static website is the best choice.)

Q9. A user types www.google.com into their browser, but the browser displays a “Server Not Found” error, even though the internet connection is active. However, accessing the site via 142.250.190.46 works. Diagnose the problem and explain the underlying technology that failed.
Answer:
• 	The issue is with the Domain Name System (DNS).
• 	DNS translates domain names (e.g., www.google.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 142.250.190.46).
• 	Since the site works with the IP but not the domain name → DNS resolution failed.
( Conclusion: The underlying technology that failed is DNS.)

Q10. A multinational corporation wants to share sensitive inventory data with specific suppliers but does not want this information available to the general public. Explain which network type (Intranet, Extranet, or Internet) they should implement and why.
Answer:
• 	The corporation should use an Extranet.
• 	Reasoning:
• 	Extranet allows secure access for selected external partners (suppliers).
• 	Unlike the Internet, it is not public.
• 	Unlike the Intranet, it is not limited to internal employees.
( Conclusion: Extranet ensures controlled access to sensitive data for authorized suppliers only.)
